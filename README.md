# Machine-Learning-Based-Prediction-of-Anti-Aging-Drug-Combinations
This project aimed to identify promising anti-aging drug combinations using generative 
models. To achieve this, two models were trained on the CMap dataset to predict drug
induced transcriptomic profiles: a baseline model and a VAE model (Figure 1). Their performance to predict drug combinations was evaluated using EDs(External Datasets) containing ground-truth 
values. Predicted transcriptomic profiles of 8,001 drug combinations were generated and fed 
into the age model to identify candidate anti-aging and reprogramming drug combinations.

Various architecture and hyperparameters were tested to improve the VAE 
model performance, including changes in the number of nodes, layers, dropout rate, activation 
function, learning rate, epochs, and batch size. 
Different combinations of these parameters were tested throughout the experimentation process to identify our final model with the 
lowest validation loss. Figure 2 shows the performance of the VAE model during training and validation. As 
expected, the training loss decreased over time indicating the increasing ability of the model 
to predict data from the training set. The validation loss indicates how well the model 
generalize to new data. The validation loss was initially high and after few epochs became 
identical to the training loss. Such behaviour is desirable and indicate that the model is neither 
overfitting (i.e., the model learns too complex patterns from the training data that do not 
generalize well to other datasets) nor underfitting (i.e., the model is not learning patterns deep 
enough from the training data to derive generalizable conclusions), and that therefore training 
should be continued. After 40 epochs it was observed an increase in the value of validation 
loss compared to training loss, indicative of overfitting, and therefore the further training was 
stopped.

When the performance of baseline model and VAE model was compared with each other, it 
was observed that the VAE model outperformed the baseline model for all single drug 
responses (Figure 3), and for a few combined drug responses (Figure 4). Among all the 
single drugs and drug pairs, the Trametinib-Palbociclib (TP) pair showed a higher correlation 
value in the VAE model, whereas the Tamoxifen-Mefloquine pair showed the lowest 
correlation value in the baseline model. While the Tamoxifen-Withaferin (TW) pair and the 
Mefloquine-Withaferin (MW) pair showed better performance in the baseline model 
compared to the VAE model, it was observed that the TW pair had a higher correlation value 
than the MW pair, indicating better prediction accuracy. Overall, VAE achieved a mean 
correlation value of 0.48 for single drug responses, outperforming the baseline model which 
had a mean correlation value of 0.35. For combined drug responses, the VAE model achieved 
a mean correlation value of 0.35, almost similar to the baseline model's mean correlation 
value of 0.34. This indicates that the performance of the VAE model and the baseline model 
were similar when it came to predicting combined drug responses.

Both the Baseline and VAE models were utilized to predict drug combinations and assess 
their age effects. In figure 5, the green points represent drug pairs 
that correspond to the top predicted scores of the age-predictive model, indicating a 
synergistic anti-aging effect caused by these drug combinations. Conversely, the red points 
represent drug pairs associated with the bottom predicted scores of the age-predictive model, 
indicating a synergistic pro-aging effect caused by these drug combinations.

In this proof-of-concept study, deep learning models were developed to predict drug 
combinations that regulate cellular aging using CMap datasets. The models demonstrated 
improved performance in predicting single drugs compared to drug combinations, likely due 
to complex drug interactions. Synergistic anti-aging combinations primarily 
consisted of reprogramming-related and pro-apoptotic drug classes, while pro-aging 
combinations involved drugs inhibiting growth or inducing senescence. The findings 
highlight the potential of deep learning in identifying drug combinations with anti-aging 
effects, but further research is needed to address limitations and expand the analysis.
